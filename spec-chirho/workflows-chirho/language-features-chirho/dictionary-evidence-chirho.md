# Dictionary evidence workflow

The dictionary pass used to decide instances by looking at Core syntax (sibling arguments,
literal markers, constructor names, binder types) and by treating a binding's ground scheme
predicates as proof. The checker already solves every constraint; this workflow hands the
pass what the checker proved, one record per source token, and the pass consults a record
before any heuristic. Programs without a record keep today's path and today's verdict.

    solve_chirho[Module solved: unification + Report defaulting composed]
    capture_chirho --> finalize_chirho[finalize_literal_evidence_chirho: type resolved to a concrete head → key; variables and rigid variables yield nothing; a span seen twice must agree]
    solve_chirho --> finalize_chirho
    finalize_chirho --> result_chirho[InferResultChirho.literal_evidence_chirho: span → LiteralEvidenceChirho]
    desugar_chirho[Desugar: literal becomes App fromInteger-occurrence lit]
    desugar_chirho --> spans_chirho[record_literal_occurrence_chirho: occurrence id → literal span]
    result_chirho --> join_chirho[join_occurrence_evidence_chirho: span-first, then the per-name ordinal join]
    spans_chirho --> join_chirho
    join_chirho --> pass_chirho[Dictionary pass occurrence_head_replacement_chirho: prim row or keyed selector from the record]
    pass_chirho --> stg_chirho[STG: the literal's fromInteger has its dictionary]
```

## Invariants

- A record names one source token: keys are spans, never per-name ordinals, so inference
  order does not have to match desugar order (a generated node has the dummy span and no
  record).
- Only a concrete head is evidence. A literal whose type is still a unification variable or a
  rigid variable produces no record; the enclosing binding's dictionary parameter (or today's
  fallback) serves it.
- A span the checker inferred more than once (a re-check, a speculative branch) yields a record
  only when every inference agreed.
- The join maps the checker's `Integer` default onto the engine's `Int` rows at the driver
  boundary and nowhere else.
- No heuristic in the pass is widened by this workflow; records are consulted first, and the
  heuristics remain the fallback until a gate retires them.

## Reference evidence (bricks 3 and 4)

    ref_chirho[Constrained reference inferred: scheme instantiated, one wanted per predicate]
    ref_chirho --> capture_ref_chirho[capture_reference_evidence_chirho: span, predicates in scheme order]
    recursive_ref_chirho[Unsigned recursive reference: span and matching monomorphic assumption] --> pending_ref_chirho[RecursiveReferencesChirho retains source identity through substitutions]
    pending_ref_chirho --> finish_ref_chirho[finish_recursive_references_chirho: SCC generalization supplies predicates for those same type variables]
    finish_ref_chirho --> finalize_ref_chirho
    capture_ref_chirho --> finalize_ref_chirho[finalize_reference_evidence_chirho: concrete head → key; rigid or generalized variable → OWN_DICTIONARY_KEY_CHIRHO; open → nothing]
    method_chirho[Method occurrence at a rigid variable] --> own_chirho[finalize_occurrence_records_chirho: OWN_DICTIONARY_KEY_CHIRHO instead of the Int default]
    desugar_ref_chirho[Desugar: reference to a name whose scheme carries predicates → reference_occurrence_chirho mints an occurrence id, canonical = the binding]
    finalize_ref_chirho --> join_ref_chirho[Driver: reference_evidence by occurrence id, span-first]
    desugar_ref_chirho --> join_ref_chirho
    join_ref_chirho --> callsite_chirho[Pass: dictionary-parameter call site and bare reference — evidence_dict_for_class_chirho per predicate: instance dictionary for a key, the binding's own parameter for OWN, today's guess for nothing]
    own_chirho --> selector_chirho[Pass: try_rewrite_method_var_chirho — $sel_C_m applied to the binding's own dictionary parameter]
```

- An own-parameter record names the signature predicate it stands for (`$own:k`, recorded when
  the signature is skolemized: `record_own_dictionary_indices_chirho`); the pass keys every
  dictionary binder by predicate index as well as by class, so two predicates of one class are
  two parameters. The class-only form (`$own`) remains for superclass extractions and for
  generalized variables, where the pass's class-keyed parameter is the right one.
- A reference occurrence is seen through by every dictionary-parameter lookup
  (`canonical_id_chirho`), and the spine pre-pass leaves an evidenced reference in place so the
  call-site path can read its records; one it finds no evidence for is restored to its
  canonical id before STG, exactly as method occurrences are.
- The higher-order-argument rewriter hands an evidenced reference to the variable arm; a key
  guessed from sibling arguments never dispatches a reference the checker proved.
- An unsigned recursive call initially has no scheme predicates to capture. Its name,
  source span and matching monomorphic assumption are retained until the existing SCC
  generalization supplies the predicates. This delays evidence capture, not inference or
  generalization. The every-capture-at-one-span agreement rule is unchanged; a shadowed
  name with a different type assumption is not treated as that recursive binding.
- Nested calls with reference evidence take the normal evidence-first rewrite path. The
  surrounding result type is not substituted for the callee's predicate type (`Eq a`
  must not become `Eq [a]` merely because a recursive deduplicator returns a list).
- Definition-side and call-side dictionary parameters share
  `resolved_pred_dictionary_chirho`: omit a parameter only if the same ground or
  permitted-default dictionary actually exists. A result-only Applicative/Monad
  variable is not a numeric default, and cannot vanish from the caller's argument list.
- Polymorphic `pure`/`return` with a scheme's own dictionary must use its method selector
  before any enclosing-monad heuristic. Their result type may be IO, Maybe or list;
  retaining their bare names would incorrectly force every call onto IO.
- Execution tests call the same unsigned recursive renderer at Int, Bool and Double,
  with a String separator, and check recursive equality on list elements. These read
  the evidence back through behavior, rather than asserting a particular internal key.

## Local bindings (brick 8)

A `let`/`where` binding generalized over a class is not in the module environment and gets no
dictionary parameter from the pass. Its evidence is the type the enclosing code instantiates it
at: `generalize_local_chirho`'s quantified variables are marked local, every instantiation of
the binding records its fresh variables (`instantiate_scheme_parts_chirho`), and
`local_specialization_key_chirho` yields a key when all of them resolve to one concrete head,
transitively when an instantiation resolves to another local binding's variable (`isPrime n =
checkDiv n 2`). Methods, literals and constrained references at that variable carry the key;
two disagreeing instantiations prove nothing and keep today's path.

## Current boundary

- Infix references (`x \`f\` y`) and operator sections still resolve through the shared
  canonical id; only prefix references mint occurrence ids.
- Class methods never mint reference occurrences (the method paths key on canonical ids);
  own-parameter evidence therefore reaches the standard method list only, and a user class
  method at a rigid variable is still dispatched by the pass's inferred parameter keys.
